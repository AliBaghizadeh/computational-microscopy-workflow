# Oxygen Diffusion in 4H-SiC via DFT and STEM Simulation

This project demonstrates how to model and simulate oxygen diffusion in 4H-SiC using **Computational Materials (with GPAW/ASE)** and simulate corresponding **atomic resolution STEM images using abTEM**.
The choice of oxygen diffusion in 4H-SiC is solely for semiconductor metrology, but the workflow can be used for many other materials. 

It is designed for educational use by junior researchers, and runs on:
- **Linux / WSL2 on Windows**
- **Google Colab (for abTEM image simulation)**

## üß† Why This Project Matters

Microscopy-based defect characterization increasingly demands synergy between **atomic-scale simulations** and **experimental STEM imaging**. However, junior researchers often encounter major barriers when trying to bridge DFT and microscopy.

### üîß Pain Points in the Field

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Heavyweight DFT tools vs practical needs**: While high-accuracy DFT codes like VASP or Wien2k are standard in academia, they are computationally intensive and often overkill for generating atomic models used in microscopy image                simulations. In contrast, GPAW/ASE provides a Python-based, lightweight alternative with sufficient accuracy for many practical defect studies, and supports scripting for automated exploration of multiple defect configurations.
- üì¶ **Limited support for batch STEM simulations**: Many STEM simulation packages‚Äîespecially closed-source or GUI-driven ones‚Äîlack automation capabilities for high-throughput simulations. abTEM, being open-source and Python-native, enables            flexible, scriptable workflows to simulate large sets of images under varying conditions (defocus, aberrations, zone axis, thickness, etc.).
- üìâ **Limited examples for defect modeling + STEM**: There is a shortage of beginner-friendly, end-to-end examples that walk users through the full process: from structure setup ‚Üí DFT relaxation ‚Üí STEM image generation. This project fills            that gap.
- üíª **Complex environments**: Installing and configuring GPAW, especially on Windows, is error-prone without HPC experience.
- ‚ùì **Lack of reproducible starter projects**: Most DFT + STEM workflows are either highly customized or too abstract for newcomers to replicate on a laptop or in Google Colab. This project is designed to be fully reproducible on modest             computing setups with annotated scripts and notebooks.

### ‚úÖ What This Project Offers

This project was designed specifically to help newcomers overcome those challenges:

- üîÅ **End-to-end reproducibility**: Includes every step from structure setup to image generation, with working input/output files.
- üß™ **Realistic but simplified modeling**: Focuses on meaningful yet computationally affordable simulations.
- üßë‚Äçüè´ **Educational clarity**: Modular scripts, in-code comments, and clearly documented workflows suitable for courses and research training.
- üí° **Cross-platform setup**: Runs on Linux or WSL2 + Google Colab, so anyone can get started ‚Äî even without HPC access.
- üîÑ **Extendable design**: Easily adapted for different dopants, host materials, or imaging geometries.

7. **STEM Simulation (abTEM)**: Simulate ABF, MAADF, and HAADF contrast using abTEM in Colab.  
   abTEM supports two main approaches:  
   - **Flexible 4D-STEM Simulation**: Generates full diffraction patterns at each scan position and allows post-hoc integration over detector angles.  
   - **Direct STEM Simulation**: Uses pre-defined annular detectors for ABF or HAADF, suitable for fast, publication-ready images.  
   üîπ This notebook is GPU-accelerated using CuPy and runs efficiently in Colab.

### üì∏ 4. STEM Simulation in Google Colab

You can simulate STEM images using **abTEM in Google Colab**. Two standalone notebooks are provided:

#### ‚úÖ Option 1: 4D-STEM with Flexible Detectors
- **File**: [`abTEM_4D_STEM_flexible_detectors.ipynb`](./4_stem_simulation/abTEM_4D_STEM_flexible_detectors.ipynb)
- Simulates full scattering using `FlexibleAnnularDetector`
- Performs radial integration to generate ABF, MAADF, HAADF images

#### ‚úÖ Option 2: Fast Scan with Fixed Detectors
- **File**: [`abTEM_fast_scan.ipynb`](./4_stem_simulation/abTEM_fast_scan.ipynb)
- Uses `AnnularDetector` for faster, predefined ABF + HAADF scans

#### üß™ To Use Either Notebook:
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload your **`relaxed_positions_only.cif`** file when prompted
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions inside the notebook:
   - Installs required packages (then restart session)
   - Builds zone-aligned structure
   - Sets up probe, scan, and detectors
   - Simulates and visualizes images
   - Saves `.png` and `.npy` outputs

Each notebook is **self-contained**, **Colab-compatible**, and includes comments to guide new users.
